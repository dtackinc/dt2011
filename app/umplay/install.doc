NCI VIDEOPLEX SUPPORT SOFTWARE INSTALLATION
18 Feb 97

INSTALLATION
------------
In the interim, the Videoplex support software is distributed as a pax file.
To install it, copy it to /tmp, then type "unpax uumplay".
This will replace all files listed in the MANIFEST section below.
Particularly note that it replaces /devel/bin/mpeg_decode.


UDB
---
The udb currently does not need to be told the decoder type.
The mpeg_decode script detects whether a Videoplex is present.
If not, it presumes that a PC Motion Pro is present and uses the
old rundos scheme.

However, we will soon require the use of the Model attribute so we
can automatically put the show_pci2 command in sysinit.

For example:
  [1]dv_decoder Model=Videoplex;

Until the udb is made Videoplex-aware, you must add the following to
the Appstart string:

  show_pci2 -v > /CONFIG/show_pci2.out



STARTING/RESTARTING
-------------------
The umplay program is always started from the /devel/bin/mpeg_decode script.
This script is called directly by sysinit, and indirectly by uadmin
when the Restart Decoder button is pressed.

VERSION
-------
To see the version number, just type "umplay -op rev".


CORTEX ALIGNMENT
----------------
The video stream presented by the Videoplex to the cortex is shifted.
This table illustrates the currently accepted values:

theoretical standard digital 76 52
theoretical standard analog  76 48
PC Motion Pro                77 50
Videoplex                    75 56

Compensation for the videoplex is done in udb with lines of the form:

Variable videoplex_vshift Name="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" Value="75";
Variable videoplex_hshift Name="xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" Value="56";
[1] DOES videoplex_vshift videoplex_hshift;


OVERLAY
-------
The Videoplex is capable of displaying up to two overlay blocks.
The content and placement of these blocks is defined in /CONFIG/umplay.cfg.
This ASCII file has comments in it describing its format.


VERSION
-------
To see the version number, just type "umplay -op rev".
