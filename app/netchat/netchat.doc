Netchat notes 1.1 2/26/97


INSTALLATION - SOUNDBLASTER
---------------------------
The netchat software works with a SoundBlaster-16.
This is a full-length 16-bit ISA card.

This board comes in two flavors: not-PnP and PnP.
With both flavors of Soundblaster you *MUST* use interrupt 5!

Both flavors use I/O 220-23f and 16-bit DMA channel 1.

You need not install or run any software received with the
board to set it up.


INSTALLATION - CRYSTAL CHIPSET
------------------------------
The netchat software also works with the on-board Crystal chipset
found on some of the Intel motherboards we use.

With the Crystal chipset you *MUST* use interrupt 5!

This option uses I/O 220-23f and 16-bit DMA channel 1.


INSTALLATION - MICROPHONE
-------------------------
You must use a standard NCI mic-to-line apparatus.  
It plugs into the LINE-IN input on the SoundBlaster.


INSTALLATION - SPEAKERS
-----------------------
The Soundblaster will work with both amplified and non-amplified
speakers.  The Crystal chipset requires amplified speakers.
Output from both the Soundblaster and the Crystal chipset is
equal in both left and right channels so only one speaker is
required.


INSTALLATION - SOFTWARE
-----------------------
Obtain the latest file named unetchat.pax.F from R&D.
Place this in the /tmp directory.  Type unpax netchat.

Obtain the udb.pax.F dated on or after 2/25/97 and unpax it.

Add the following to site.udb: sound(1);
This will add the following to sysinit:  /devel/bin/netchat.sh init_node

Add the following lines to /CONFIG/custom_list:
"-"   ""
"      NetChat         " "/bin/sh /devel/bin/netchat.sh start_node"
"   NetChat Cycle      " "/bin/sh /devel/bin/netchat.sh restart_node"


INSTALLATION - TESTING
----------------------

1. Hardware Testing
After unpaxing unetchat.pax.F, test the hardware as follows:

  Audio sb -i 5 &
  cat /devel/test/uaudio/houston.pcm > /dev/dsp
  dttaudio play
  dttaudio record

2. Automated testing
After ugen and udist with the sound() macros in site.udb, reboot
all nodes and start the netchat delete via the Custom List on each node.
Make sure all Netchats are idle before each test.

  netchat.sh test1 AUDxx
  netchat.sh test2 AUDxx AUDyy
  netchat.sh test3 AUDxx AUDyy AUDzz

3. Click testing
These tests will ask you to click certain things then hit enter.
Make sure all Netchats are idle before each test.

  netchat.sh qc2 AUDxx AUDyy
  netchat.sh qc3 AUDxx AUDyy AUDzz


DEBUGGING AND DIAGNOSING
------------------------
The logs may be examined with:

Utail ustream.AUDxx      audio bytes shoveling
Utail netchat.AUDyy      front end user interface

You can increase the amount of debug by changing the ustream_dbg and/or
netchat_dbg variables at the start of netchat.sh.  String the values
together with + signs, for example:

  netchat_dbg=usr1+usr2+command

Here are the debug classes:

  alimits - system limits            memstats - memory summary at end
  all     - all debug masks          memtrace - memory allocation
  alt     - program alternatives     memx     - big memory interface
  arg     - command line args        object   - object values
  assert  - program assertions       page     - memory paging
  async   - asynchronous events      pixel    - pixel values
  bigio   - big blocks of I/O        stats    - statistics
  complex - execution complexity     time     - execution times
  img     - image operations         trace    - execution trace
  intermd - intermediate values      usr1     - user's use
  io      - all file I/O             usr2     - user's use
  ipc     - interprocess comm        win      - client/server window
