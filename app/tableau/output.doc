|!Frame destinations
| Tableau can send output frames to any of several destinations.
| A single instance of tableau can only be outputting to one destination.
| 
| You tell tableau which destination to use with the -screen line in the arg file.
| The general format of the -screen line is:
|
|:   -screen destination,spec,mod1,mod2,...
|
| Where:
| The commas must be there to separate the other fields.
| There must be no spaces in keyword value.
| The fields are:
|
| destination	is one of the strings from the table below
| spec		identifies which destination
| modn		modifier, exact number and meaning is destination dependent
|
| Allowed values for destination are:
| ftp		output to ftp server
| rocket	output directly to listening rocket server
| http		start rocket server as CGI then output to it
| roll		output to local disk
| hws		output to display window
|
|.Ftp output
| Use this type of destination to send the frames to any ftp server.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -screen ftp,directory/pattern
|
| Where:
| directory	name of directory on remote host to "cd" to
| pattern	filename pattern to generate
| 
| The pattern must have one optional :%s: subfield 
| followed by one optional :%ld: subfield.
| These subfields are replaced by the camera name and frame number, respectively.
| For example, camera "mycam" at frame 4858:
| 
| :my/image/dir/%s.%08ld.jpg:		my/image/dir/mycam.00004858.jpg
| :my/image/dir/%s.jpg:				my/image/dir/mycam.jpg
| :my/image/dir/somename.jpg:		my/image/dir/somename.jpg
|
| This type of destination requires a separate ftp config file.
| This file is called ftp.cfg.
| It contains the ftp host, port, user, and password.
| The format of ftp.cfg is fully covered in the Tableau 
| Video Caesar Documentation.
| 
|.Rocket direct output
| Use this type of destination to send frames to a rocket server.
| The rocket server must be ready and listening.
|
| Keyword format:
|:   -screen rocket,host:port
|:   -screen rocket,host:port+directory
|
| Where host and port are the computer and tableau server's port.
| The optional directory tells the tableau server where to put
| the incoming frames.
| The server commands the given directory onto its -path keyword
| to make a complete path name.
| 
| Some Internet web servers allow you to keep a tableau rocket server running.
| Typically this involves having a watchdog program restart the server.
| If the rocket server cannot be kept running,
| you should use the -screen http destination type.
| 
|.Rocket CGI output
| Use this type of destination if the tableau rocket server needs to be
| started.
| Tableau initiates this type of destination by first making a CGI request.
| The web server on the specified host must launch a tableau rocket server instance.
| The client tableau then connects to the rocket server.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -screen http://host:port?nph-cgi/ident=directory&arg1&arg2...
| 
| The words "http" and "ident=" and the punctuation are literal.
| The port must be given even if it is 80.
| The variable fields are:
| 
| host		web server host name or IP address
| port		web server port, required even if 80
| nph-cgi	name of CGI script which starts the tableau rocket server
| directory	tells rocket server where to put the images
| argN		extra CGI arguments understood by the CGI script
| 
| Starting a tableau rocket server is not supported by all operating systems.
| In particular, Windows NT and Linux may not use it.
|
|.Local disk output
| Use this type of destination to save image files to a hard disk.
| This is not really a network destination unless the hard disk is remote.
|
| Keyword format:
|:   -screen roll,directory
| 
| The directory name is appended to the current -path keyword.
| Together they form a full path name to the directory where frames are saved.
| Each time a frame is saved, the roll file is update with the frame number.
| The frame filenames are of the form:
| 
|:    camname.00000000.color.enc
| 
| Camname is replaced by the camera's name from the cam.lst file.
| The number 0000000 is replaced by the current frame number.
| Color is replaced by the color format, either :rgb888: or :luminamce:.
| The suffix :.enc: is fixed and cannot be changed.
|
| The -dz keyword controls how many files are saved before deleting the oldest.
| 
|.Screen output
| Use this type of destination to show the frames in a local window.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -screen hws,fgw            (windows)
|:   -screen hws,x,display,DRS  (Unix)
|
| All fields are literal except "display" which should be replaced
| with the destination X server spec.
| Display may be left blank (i.e. :-screen hes,x,,DRS:)
| 
| This is normally unnecessary with VfW framegrabbers since the driver itself
| displays the video in an overlay window.
| However, on Unix systems, the driver does not.
| This type of destination allows the console operator to see the video
| without running a web server or using a browser.
