|!Arg file
| All of the following keywords may appear in the .arg file.
| Each keyword must appear on a line by itself.
| The first character on each line must be the '-'.
| If the keyword appears in the file more than once, only the last occurrence
| is honored.
| Each keyword must be followed by exactly one blank-delimited token.
| If the token contains blanks, it must be surrounded by quotes.
| Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
| 
| Warning: tableau does not gracefully handle an invalid .arg file.
| At best you may get a GPF.
| At worst, tableau exits with no warning or other message.
|
| This table summarizes the keywords.
| The value in parentheses is the default.
| 
| -background	frames between color computation (0)
| -cache	ipc listen spec (NULL)
| -color	color format to encode (rgb888)
| -config	directory containing other config files (NULL)
| -connect	listen port (NULL)
| -dbg		debug flags (empty)
| -dbgto	debug file (console)
| -dt		wait time between frames in milliseconds (0)
| -dx		display x zoom (1)
| -dy		display y zoom (1)
| -dz		number of frames to keep (100)
| -epsilon	ipc wait in milliseconds (-1)
| -errto	error file (console)
| -ident	reverb server spec (NULL)
| -input	source of video pump (vfw,Creative,320,240)

| -sigma	number of frames to average (1)
| -t		jpeg quality (25)
| -variant	type of encoding (jpeg)
| 
|.-background
| frames between color computation (0)
| 
| This numeric value specifies how often the color lookup table is recomputed.
| On X windows, there will be a screen flash whenever this occurs.
| However, the lookup table is optimized for the frame on which it is computed.
| Therefore, if -background is too high, color degradation will occur.
| A good value is 20 or so.
|
| This keyword is used only when -screen is "hws,".
| That is, when tableau is outputting directly to a display window.
| 
|.-cache
| ipc listen spec (NULL)
|
| Tableau can listen for Dynamic commands while it is running.
| For example, the jpeg quality can be changed on the fly.
| The -cache keyword specifies ipc spec on which to listen for dynamic commands.
| A special client must be used to send the dynamic commands.
|
| This keyword should be used only in special circumstances.
| It is not well tested.
| It could impact performance.
| 
|.-color
| color format to encode (rgb888)
|
| This keyword specifies the color format to which images
| are converted before encoding.
| Possible values are:
| 
| :y:		luminance
| :ycbycr:	4-4-4 band interleaved
| :ycbcr:	4-2-2 band interleaved
| :y_cb_cr:	4-4-4 band sequential
| :y_cb_cr_411:	4-1-1 band sequential
| :cb:		blue chromatic component
| :cr:		red chromaatic component
| :yuyv:	4-2-2 band interleaved
| :rgb888:	24-bit RGB band interleaved
| :r_g_b:	24-bit RGB band sequential
| :rgb565:	16-bit RGB band interleaved
| :rgb555:	15-bit RGB band interleaved
| :pseudo:	pseudo color with generated map
| :map:		forced psuedo color
|
| This keyword should be used only in special circumstances.
| Not all values for -color will work with all values of -variant.
| 
|.-config
| directory containing other config files (NULL)
|
| This keyword specifies the directory which contains auxiliary config files.
| For example, the camera list, the camera schedules, and the ftp login
| information files are all kept in this directory.
| 
| The value for this keyword depends completely on the directory
| structure convention created by the installation package.
| This keyword is required only in non-server mode.
| 
|.-connect
| listen spec (NULL)
|
| The listen spec follows the format: 
|:   rocket,host:port
| 
| Where the ',' and ':' are literal and
| rocket	literal
| host		host name or IP address
| port		TCP/IP port (note: MUST be given, even if 80)
| 
| Use of this keyword puts tableau into server mode.
| In server mode, tableau shovels data in one of two ways:
| 1.	from -input source to ipc connection
| 2.	from ipc connection to -screen destination
| 
| In the first case, tableau acts like a push server.
| It gets data from a framegrabber, fileset, or another tableau
| and sends it to the client.
| 
| In the second case, tableau acts like capture server.
| It gets data from the client and sends it it to a fileset or another tableau.
|
| In production cases, tableau only runs as a server
| when it receives frames from a capture computer and puts them in files.
| In experimental cases, tableau can be used as a dedicated video server.
| 
| It can also be used to relay video to another networked tableau.
| In this way a chain of tableaux can be created.
| 
|.-D
| debug flags (empty)
|
| This keyword tells how much debug should be generated.
| All debug is sent to the location specified by -dbgto.
| The debug flags should be separated by '+' signs and no spaces.
| for example :-D img+complex:.
| Any suboption may be abbreviated to the shortest form
| which is not ambiguous with other suboptions.
| All possible suboptions are listed in two columns below:
| 
|:alimits - system limits            memstats - memory summary at end
|:all     - all debug masks          memtrace - memory allocation
|:alt     - program alternatives     memx     - big memory interface
|:arg     - command line args        object   - object values
|:assert  - program assertions       page     - memory paging
|:async   - asynchronous events      pixel    - pixel values
|:bigio   - big blocks of I/O        stats    - statistics
|:complex - execution complexity     time     - execution times
|:img     - image operations         trace    - execution trace
|:intermd - intermediate values      usr1     - user's use
|:io      - all file I/O             usr2     - user's use
|:ipc     - interprocess comm        win      - client/server window|
| 
| An invalid value for this keyword can cause tableau to quit with no errors.
| 
|.-dbgto
| debug file (console)
|
| This keyword tells where to write the debug.
| It should be a filename.
|
| The amount and type of debug is control by the -D keyword.
| Some debug flags can create a large amount of output.
| This can slow tableau down and fill up your disk.
|
| See the "Debug and error output" section for more details.
|
|.-dt
| wait time between frames in milliseconds (0)
|
| This numeric value should be a number of milliseconds.
| After sending or writing a frame, tableau will sleep for this long.
| This delay applies to all streams, irregardless of their schedules.
| 
| Use this keyword to slow tableau down if necessary.
| You can also use the tableau scheduler to slow individual streams.
| 
|.-dx
| display x zoom (1)
| 
| This numeric value specifies the display zoom factor.
| The bigger the number, the bigger the window.
| Interpolation is used.
|
| This keyword is used only when -screen is "hws,".
| That is, when tableau is outputting directly to a display window.
| 
|.-dy
| display y zoom (1)
|
| See -dx.
| 
|.-dz
| number of frames to keep (100)
|
| This numeric value tells tableau how many frames to keep.
| After tableau writes frame number N,
| it deletes frame number N-dz.
|
| Tableau ignores this keyword unless it is in server mode and
| one of the two cases is true:
| 1.	-screen specifies roll output
| 2.	-screen specifies ftp output
| 
|.-epsilon
| ipc wait in milliseconds (-1)
|
| Tableau will only wait this long when expecting for an ack from an ipc peer.
| It is a fatal error if the peer does not communicate within this time.
| 
| This keyword is used in the rocket protocol (-connect rocket).
| It is also used when tableau is using HTTP to start a rocket peer
| (-screen http).
| 
|.-errto
| error file (console)
|
| This keyword tells where to write error messages.
| It should be a filename.
|
| See the "Debug and error output" section for more details.
|
|.-ident
| reverb server spec (NULL)
|
| If this keyword is given, then tableau will periodically contact
| the given reverb server.
|
| The reverb server is only used for dynamic name-to-IP address mapping.
| It is completely unnecessary when you have a fixed IP address.
| The only known reverb server runs on dtack.com and is not completely
| reliable.
| 
| This keyword is not well tested.
| If the given reverb server is not behaving correctly,
| then tableau's performance will suffer.
| 
|.-input
| source of video frames is Bttv framegrabber
|
| This keyword lets you tell tableau where to get input frames from.
| Input frames can come from:
| -	framebuffer
| -	synthesizer
| -	tableau server
| -	file playlist
| -	files as they arrive from capture
|
| See the "Input sources" section for more details.
| 
|.-max
| max time to wait in milliseconds (180000)
|
| This keyword specifies how long to wait for the next file in sequence.
| 
| This keyword is ignored unless serial-file input is specified
| (-input ser).
| 
|.-n
| number of frames to do (0)
|
| Tableau pumps this many frames and then stops.
| If 0, an unlimited number of frames is transferred.
|
| Use this keyword if you want to limit the number of frames transferred.
| It is especially useful in a thumbnail situation if you just want to
| thumbnail the latest image alone.
| 
|.-offset
| first frame (0)
|
| This number tells tableau what frame number should be transferred first.
|
| It can be used by a ipc client to give the first frame number.
| It can be used in push mode (-input roll) to specify the 
| first file sequence number.
|
| This keyword should be used only in special circumstances.
| This is not recommended.
| 
|.-op
| timestamp and clipping operation (raw)
|
| This keyword lets you specify an image operation
| on the full image after it has been grabbed or decoded.
| Tableau performs the image before encoding it.
|
| The possible operations are:
| raw		do nothing
| stamp		add timestamp to bottom
| trim		clip edges of image, shrink it and add timestamp
| 
| See the "Image operations" section for more details.
| 
|.-path
| roll file path (/img/tableau)
|
| The value of this keyword is prepended before any input
| or output frame filename.
| Several other keywords allow you to specify what comes after the path.
| 
| Splitting up the output path in this way allows one server
| to handle multiple streams.
| Each stream only needs to give the second part of the path.
| The server chooses the first part using this keyword.
| 
|.-psi
| sponge factor (100000)
|
| Tableau will not send any more frames if the number of bytes
| sent exceeds the number of bytes acked by this amount.
| 
| For quicker response to commands such as PTZ or quality changes,
| use a lower number.
| For a higher frame rate, use a higher number.
| The Internet will typically not provide faster throughput above 50000.
| 
|.-sayto
| special message file (console)
|
| This keyword tells where to write special messages.
| It should be a filename.
|
| Special messages are currently only used for unusual warnings.
| We recommend you send these messages to the error output.
| 
| See the "Debug and error output" section for more details.
| 
|.-screen
| destination of video pump (rocket,156.46.122.16:5710+be.x)
|
| Tableau can do any of several things with the encoded frame, including
| sending it to:
| 
| -	ftp server
| -	tableau server
| -	tableau rocket server started as CGI
| -	display window
| 
| See the "Frame destinations" section for more details.
| 
|.-sigma
| number of frames to average (1)
|
| Tableau will capture this many frames and take the arithmetic average
| of each pixel.
| Use it to smooth spiky noise which helps some encoders.
| 
|.-t
| jpeg quality (25)
|
| This keyword controls the jpeg quality.
| A value of 100 is the best and is virtually lossless.
| However, the file size is larger.
| It can be up to 60K for a 320x240 image (4:1 compression).
|
| A very low value will give a highly pixelized and color-banded,
| but small, image.
|
| Each scene and application will need to adjust this value to suit.
| 
|.-variant
| type of encoding (jpeg)
|
| The possible values for this keyword are:
| uncompressed	save image as raw pixels
| jpeg		perform jpeg compression
| passthrough	pass input encoding through to output without change
|
| The uncompressed variant can be used to save a lossless image stream.
| Jpeg is normally used on the capture tableau.
| Passthrough is normally used by a tableau server
| which receives frames from an ipc peer and saves them to disk
| without change.
