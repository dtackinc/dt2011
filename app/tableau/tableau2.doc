|.REMOTE CONTROL
| You can control video capture from a remote location.
| The remote location must be on the same Internet as the Video Caesar.
| On any web browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer,
| simply enter a URL of the form:
| 
|:  http://123.456.789.123:5710/access_code
| 
| Substitute the IP address of Video Caesar for the number 123.456.789.123.
| Substitute the Video Caesar's assigned port for the number 5710.
| Finally, substitute your private access code.
| 
| From the remote control panel, you can do any of the following:
| - change the access code
| - set the weekly schedule of operations
| - restart the capture software
| - restart the computer
| - monitor the activity log
|
|.LOCAL CONTROL
| For local control, you must connect a VGA monitor to the Video Caesar.
| Under local control, you can do any of the following:
| - change the access code
| - set the weekly schedule of operations
| - restart the capture software
| - restart the computer
| - monitor the activity log
| - change the destination to which video is sent
| - change the image size
| - change the image quality
| - disable or enable remote control
| 
|.SECURITY
| For absolute security, remote control must be disabled.
| Remote control security is based simply on unpublished information.
| The following pieces of information are required to exercise remote control:
| - the IP address
| - the port
| - the access code
| This type of security is very poor.
| A determined hacker could easily determine all required pieces of information.
| The only sure method of keeping out intruders is to disable remote control.
