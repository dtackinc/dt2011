|!Image operations
| Tableau can perform a limited number of operations on the raw
| image after it has been input from the frame source.
|
| The operation is specified with the -op keyword.
| The format of the keyword is:
| 
|:   -op op,extra
| 
| Where op is a choice from the table below.
| Extra is different depending on the operation.
|
| The possible operations are:
| raw		do nothing
| stamp		add timestamp to bottom
| trim		clip edges of image, shrink it and add timestamp
|
|.Raw
| This type of operation simply does not change the image.
| This is the default for the -op keyword.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -op raw
| 
|.Stamp
| Use this type of operation to add text to the bottom of the image.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -op "stamp,text"
|
| Where text is a mixture of literal text and substitution fields.
| The text may contain spaces but may not contain the '"' character.
| Each substitution string begins with a '%' character.
| For a complete list of substitution strings, please see
| "Appendix A: Time stamp substitution strings".
|
| Each character in the time stamp is 8 pixels wide.
| You must ensure that the length of the time stamp string does not
| exceed the width of your image.
| 
| This type of operation adds a timestamp to the bottom of the image.
| The time stamp is centered horizontally.
| The character font is a fixed-width font.
| Each character is 8 pixels wide.
| The time stamp is 16 rows high.
| The background is black and the characters white.
| 
|.Trim
| Use this type of operation to chop off part of the image.
| Any number of rows and/or columns can be chopped off any edge.
| Optionally, a time stamp can be added.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:  -op "trim/x0/y0/x1/y1/stride,text"
| 
| Where:
| x0		number of columns to chop of the left
| y0		number of rows to chop off the top
| x1		number of columns to chop off the right
| y1		number of rows to chop off the bottom
| stride	stride from current row/column to next (minimum 1)
| text		timestamp text as in the previous section
| 
| This type of operation is useful in removing an unwanted
| part of the image.
| It can also shrink the image by skipping rows and columns.
