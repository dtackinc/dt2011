| Thanks for buying from Tableau!

| pieces of information relating to your computer, network, and server.
| Take a moment now to gather these pieces of information.

| Most of these pieces of information are supplied by your network manager.
| 
| #COMPUTER IDENTITY#
|

| 
| #FTP SERVER AND LOGIN#
| 
| Your Video Caesar software will try to send video images to
| an FTP server on your network or the Internet.
| 
| _____________________________	FTP server's name or IP address.
| 				This is the computer to which images go.
| _____________________________	FTP server's port.
| 				This is almost always 21,
| 				but may be different in some circumstances.
| _____________________________	FTP login.
| 				This is the user name by which you log in 
| 				to your FTP server.
