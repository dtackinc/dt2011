|!Input sources
| Tableau acquires video frames from several possible sources.
| You tell tableau which source to use with the -input line in the arg file.
| The general format of the -input line is:
|
|:   -input source,spec,mod1,mod2,...
|
| Where:
| The commas must be there to separate the other fields.
| There must be no spaces in keyword value.
| The fields are:
|
| source	is one of the strings from the table below
| spec		identifies which source
| modn		modifier, exact number and meaning is source dependent
|
| Allowed values for source are:
| vfw		Video for Windows framegrabber
| bt		Bttv framegrabber for Linux
| rocket	ipc connection to another tableau
| gen		synthesize
| roll		frames as they arrive from capture
| ser		prepared frames from playlist or files from a directory
| file		shared file
|
|.Video for Windows input
| Use this type of input on Windows 95 or Windows NT with a framegrabber.
| You should have a Video for Windows driver installed for your framegrabber.
|
| Keyword format:
|:   -input vfw,name,width,height
|:   -input vfw,name,width,height,flag1+flag2...
| 
| The value for name should be the unambiguous abbreviation
| of a valid framegrabber in your system.
| Width and height should be valid for your framegrabber.
| 
| Possible values for flagn are:
| setsize	force setting of given width and height
| fmtdlg	run VfW Format Dialog at startup
| srcdlg	run VfW Source Dialog at startup
|
|.Bttv for Linux input
| Use this type of input on Linux with a Bt848-based framegrabber.
| You should have the shareware bttv driver installed.
|
| Keyword formatS:
|:   -input bt,name,width,height
|:   -input bt,name,width,height,flag1+flag2...
| 
| The value for name should be a device name such as /dev/bttv.
| Width and height should be reasonable values.
| 
| Possible values for flagn are:
| skip		grab only even lines of twice-tall image
| dup		grab all lines but ignore odd lines
| interlace	run board in interlace mode
|
|.Rocket input
| Use this type of input when talking directly to another tableau.
| This type uses the rocket protocol.
|
| Keyword format:
|:   -input rocket,host:port
|
| Example scenario:
| Dedicated tableau server listens on port for rocket connection.
| Client makes connection via -input rocket.
| Server gets frames from framegrabber or wherever and sends to client.
|
|.Synthesized input
| Use this type of input when you have no framegrabber
| yet still want to generate video frames.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -input gen,count,width,height
|:   -input gen,sweep,width,height
| 
| The "sweep" synthesized frames have a single line pivoting around the center.
| The "count" frames have an incrementing number.
| If neither type is given, "count" is used.
|
|.Arriving frame input
| Use this type of input when picking up new files being deposited
| by another tableau.
| The other tableau will be writing new files and updating the roll file.
| This tableau will be waiting for the roll file to change
| and reading files when it does.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -input roll,directory
|
| The directory name is appended to the -path keyword.
|
| This type of input is slightly more efficient than
| the form -input,ser which can do the same thing without the roll file.
|
|.Prepared frames input
| Use this type of input to play a list of prepared frames.
| This form can also pick up arriving files.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -input ser,filename
| 
| Filename should be an ASCII file.
| If the first line of the file contains a '%' character,
| tableau assumes this is a filename pattern.
| Tableau scans the given directory and outputs the matching files.
| If the first line does not contain a '%' character,
| tableau assumes that all lines in the file contain
| either a image filename or the word "loop".
| If "loop" is found, the tableau rereads the file from the beginning.
|
| This type of input can be used when files are arriving from ftp.
| Since ftp creates no roll file -input roll cannot be used.
|
|.Shared file input
| Use this type of input in conjunction with the tabgrab program.
| Tabgrab gets input from a framegrabber and writes it to the same shared
| file or memory over and over.
| Tableau sends a message to tabgrab for each frame then reads the frame
| from the shared file or memory.
| 
| Keyword format:
|:   -input file,spec
|
| Spec should give the ipc spec of a networked tabgrab.
|
| This type of input is useful when you want multiple tableaux to get frames
| from the same framegrabber.
| Tabgrab asynchronously writes frames to a file which many tableaux can read.
| For example, one tableau might serve the images to a tableau server
| while another tableau serves frames directly to a client.
| 
| This type of input cannot currently be used in a multi-camera
| installation.
