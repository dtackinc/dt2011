|!Usage scenarios
| Tableau can operate in a variety of scenarios.
| This section outlines some of the more important scenarios.
| 
| To summarize:
| thumbnail			periodically recompress the latest frame
| capture to disk		framegrab and save frames to disk
| capture to ftp		framegrab and send frames to ftp server
| capture to rocket		framegrab and send frames to rocket server
| capture to rocket via CGI	framegrab and send frames to CGI rocket server
| dedicated rocket server	act as rocket server and save frames to dist
| forking rocket server		forking rocket server
| relay server			rocket server which passes to other rocket
|
| There certainly are other scenarios in which tableau can be used.
|
|.Capture to disk scenario
| In this scenario tableau saves frames to the local or networked disk.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input vfw,...	input from framegrabber
| -path			directory prefix
| -screen roll,subdir	destination type and directory suffix
| -dz N			delete Nth oldest frame
| -dt milliseconds	how long to delay between frames
|
| Use this scenario if you have the ability to save files
| to a disk which is shared with the web server.
| Note, however, that the rocket scenario is always faster, even on a LAN.
| 
| You may also wish to capture a sequence and make a playlist.
| In this case make sure to set -dz high.
| Use -dt to slow things down if necessary.
| 
|.Capture to ftp scenario
| In this scenario, tableau sends frames to any standard ftp server.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input vfw,...	input from framegrabber
| -screen ftp,...	destination type and directory suffix
| -dz N			delete Nth oldest frame
|
| In addition to tableau.arg, you must edit the ftp.cfg file.
| Enter your ftp server and login information there.
|
|.Capture to rocket scenario
| In this scenario, tableau sends frames to a rocket server.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input vfw,...	input from framegrabber
| -screen rocket,...	destination type and rocket receiver spec
| 
| The rocket server is expected to be listening on the server computer.
|
|.Capture to rocket via CGI scenario
| In this scenario, tableau sends frames to a rocket server.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input vfw,...	input from framegrabber
| -screen http://...	destination type and remote CGI URL
| 
| Before frame transfer starts, tableau tells a remote web server
| to instantiate a rocket receiver has a CGI program.
|
|.Relay scenario
| In this scenario, tableau picks up files as they arrive on disk.
| It sends them to a tableau rocket server.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input ser,filename		input from disk directory
| -screen rocket,...		destination type to rocket server
| -variant passthrough		don't decode the incoming frames
|
| Use this scenario to relay frames.
| For example consider a 6-tableau setup.
| Let a framegrabber tableau(1) send files to a tableau(2) rocket server
| who stores them on disk.
| Let a relay tableau(3) pick them up off disk and send them
| to yet another tableau(4) rocket server on the west coast.
| Let a second relay tableau(5) also pick frames up off disk and send them
| to the last tableau(6) rocket server on the east coast.
|
|.Thumbnail scenario
| In this scenario, tableau wakes up infrequently to read the latest frame.
| It decodes and recompresses the frame into a thumbnail.
| 
| Important keywords:
| -input ser,filename		input from disk directory
| -screen roll,...		output to disk
| -path directory		output directory prefix
| -op trim/0/0/0/16/2		cut off timestamp and shrink by factor of 2
| -n 1				do only one frame
| 
| Since this example uses roll output, output filename will have the goofy
| :.rgb888.enc: extension.
| A shell script can easily be wrapped around tableau to rename
| the filename to whatever is desired.
| 
|.Dedicated rocket server scenario
| In this scenario, tableau runs as a server.
| It waits for another tableau to connect to it and send frames.
| It stores the frames on the hard disk.
| 
| -connect rocket,host:port!	run in dedicated server mode
| -path directory		directory prefix
| -screen roll			destination type
| -dz N				delete Nth oldest frame
| -variant passthrough		don't decode the incoming frames
|
| This tableau must be started from the command line or a system init file.
| This tableau exits once a conversation is complete.
| It must be restarted by some external means.
|
|.Forking rocket server
| In this scenario, tableau runs as a server.
| It waits for another tableau to connect to it.
| Upon a connect request, it forks a child tableau to handle incoming frames.
| The child tableau stores the frames on the hard disk.
| 
| -connect rocket,host:port	run in forking server mode
| -path directory		directory prefix
| -screen roll			destination type
| -dz N				delete Nth oldest frame
| -variant passthrough		don't decode the incoming frames
|
| This tableau must be started from the command line or a system init file.
| The child tableau exits once a conversation is complete.
| The momma tableau continues to accept connection requests from clients.
| This scenario can handle any number of clients simultaneously.
