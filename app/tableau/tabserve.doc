|!Video Caesar Server-side Setup Instructions for Win32
| Thanks for buying from Tableau!
|
| These instructions will tell you how to install the Tableau Server-side.
| The Server-side receives images from Tableau on the capture computer and stores
| them to hard disk.
| Its function is very much like an FTP server.
| However, the Tableau Server-side is much faster than FTP.
| 
| The Tableau Server-side is the same program as the Tableau
| Video Caesar capture program.
| What makes it different is its configuration file.
|
| It is our sincere wish that your experience with the Video Caesar
| web cam system is pleasant and rewarding.
|
| Please call us at 1.800.221.7583 with any questions.
| 
|.Install software
|_index installation
| Follow these instructions to install Tableau
| on both the capture and server computers.
|
| #Note you must have version 01-01 or later of the Tableau Software.#
| Versions 00-YY will not work as the Server-side.
| 
|_Aside Get it from the Internet.
| 1.	Download the distribution file #tabXX-YY.exe# from Tableau's web site.
| 		It can be found at #http://www.tableau.com/download.html#.
|		Place the file in #C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP# 
| 		or some other suitable directory.
| 2.	Open a DOS Box by clicking ~Start->Programs->MS-DOS Prompt~.
| 3.	Type #CD \\WINDOWS\\TEMP# to change to the temporary directory
| 		from step1.
| 4.	Type #TABXX-YY.EXE# to run the self-extracting install program.
|		When asked, you MUST accept the default destination directory 
|		#C:\\TABLEAU#.
| The installation program unpacks some temporary files in the current
| directory which it removes when finished.
| All files are installed into the destination directory tree #C:\\TABLEAU#.
| No files are installed in any Windows system directories.
| 
|.Customizing (Capture side)
| Follow the Customization instructions given in the document entitled
| ~Video Caesar Documentation~
| to set up the capture computer.
|
| In the file #c:\tableau\config\tableau.arg# on the capture computer
| use a -screen line like:
|
|:   -screen rocket,192.9.200.4:5710
|
| Use the IP address of your server computer instead of :192.9.200.4:.
| 
|.Customizing (Server side)
| Follow the Customization instructions given in the document entitled
| ~Video Caesar Documentation~
| to set up the server computer.
|
| Replace the entire contents of the file #c:\tableau\config\tableau.arg#
| with the following:
| 
|:   -connect rocket,0:5710!
|:   -path \webcam
|:   -screen roll,unit1
|:   -variant passthrough
|:   -errto c:\tableau\logs\tabserve.log
|:   -dbgto c:\tableau\logs\tabserve.log
|:   -sayto c:\tableau\logs\tabserve.log
|
| Substitute the following:
| :\webcam:		a directory on your system
| :unit:		a subdirectory of :\webcam:
|
| Files stored into the directory :\webcam\unit1:
| will have names of the form :cam0.00000001.rgb888.enc:.
| These names are not changeable at the current time.
| 
| The CGI program :dtspush.exe: conveniently understands these filenames.
| From these files, :dtspush.exe: puts out standard multi-part mime
| which Netscape interprets as smooth continuous video.
| Java applets are available from Tableau which
| decode the multi-part mime for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
| 
| Both :dtspush.exe: and the Java applets are available in
| source code and compiled form from Tableau.
|
|.Starting
| To start Tableau, choose #Start->Programs->Tableau XX-YY->Tabstart#.
| This will start both Tabchief and Tableau on both computers.
| It will also cause a restart either of these programs should they
| terminate for any reason.
|
| To have Tableau start at Windows boot-time,
| place the Tabstart shortcut into your Startup folder
| on both the capture and server computers.
| 
|.Troubleshooting
| The most useful way to determine the origin of any problems
| is to look at the log files in #c:\tableau\logs# on both 
| the capture and server computers.
|
| #Good luck!#
