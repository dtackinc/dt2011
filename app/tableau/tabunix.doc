|
|!External connection
| 1.	Connect your computer to your 10Base2 or 10BaseT ethernet.
|		Note: the system is shipped for 10Base2 (thin coax),
|		and may require hardware setup to switch to 10BaseT (twisted pair).
| 2.	Plug in the mouse and keyboard supplied with your system.
| 3.	Connect any standard VGA monitor.
| 4.	Hook up your NTSC video signal.
| 5.	Plug in the power cord.
| 
|!Initial configuration
| Your computer may be shipped with an IP address which is meaningless on 
| your network.
| If so, please refer to the Procedures section below
| for changing the IP address.
| 
| Your computer is configured to send jpeg via the rocket protocol to itself.
| It is capable of acting as a web server for its own live video.
| To see the live video, point an external browser to the url:
| 
|   http://12.34.56.78/site1.html
| 
| Replace the :12.34.56.78: with the IP address of your system.
| 
| \<img src="../gifs/tabunix-init.gif" alt="initial configuration"\>
|
| This is an inefficient configuration,  
| to be used for demonstration purposes only.
| You should probably send the jpeg files via the rocket protocol
| to your main web server computer.
| 
| Please contact Tableau for advice on customizing the configuration
| to your exact needs.
| 
|!Procedures
| The following procedures allow you to control your computer.
| 
|.Login
| Enter an account name at ~Ident:~ and
| password at ~Confirm:~.
|
| There are passwords for each of three accounts:
| #root#	system maintenance account
| #pump#	non-privileged access mainly to show on-screen video
| #demo#	generic login with standard Linux GUI interface
|
| Get your passwords for each account via phone or email from Tableau.
|
|.Logout
| To return to the login screen from any account,
| click your mouse anywhere on the blue-green desktop.
| Then select "Exit" or "Exit Fvwm" from the popup menu.
|

| These programs each have an argument file:
| tabstart		watchdog to start, monitor and restart other programs
| tabgrab		grab raw image from frame grabber
| tabrocket		compress raw image and send to rocket server
| tabserve		rocket server to receive images from tabrocket

| Each program in the list above has a log file.
| Normally only startup and error messages are written to the log files.
| However, when debug is enabled, more information is written there.

| Standard Linux servers are active on this computer.

| is to look at the log files in #c:\tableau\logs# on both 
| the capture and server computers.
