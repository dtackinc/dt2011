| This section gives some useful tricks and hints when using tableau.
| 
|.Startup problems
| If tableau fails to start and makes no log entries,
| then its .arg file is messed up.
| Switch back to the provided sample .arg file.
| 
|.Video problems
| For Vfw framegrabbers,
| enable the setup dialog by adding ",setsize+fmtdlg+srcdlg"
| to the end of the -input keyword's value.
|
|.Check logs
| Tableau writes all its error messages to its log file.
| If tableau fails to work, always check the log file.
| 
|.Enable debug
| To see more of what tableau is doing,
| add a -D keyword.
| The subfields following -D should be separated by '+' signs.
| Some useful subfields and what they help diagnose are:
| 
| usr1		program startup and termination
| usr2		frame sizes and timings
| ipc		Internet problems
| schedule	camera schedule problems
| command	commands to rocket and ftp servers
| reply		replies from rocket and ftp servers
| bigio		file I/O problems
| complex	jpeg information
|
| See the "Debug and error output" section for more details.
