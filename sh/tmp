hi,
I've been emailing with this company called 4i2i that has a software codec.
They have a web page at http://www.scotweb.com/4i2i/home.htm.
I'm going to see if they will run a sample of color video
which I have captured.  What do you think?
Dave



If you have a chance, try Dtack's home page again.

  http://www.msn.fullfeed.com/~erb/dist/bob/dthome.htm

You should be able to follow all links except ones marked 
with the under-construction icon.

Make sure you can't get to anything not in the bob
subdirectory.

I am concerned about the narrowness of fullfeed's link
to the Internet.  If you could, please give me some
feedback on how quick the connection to fullfeed is
made and how fast the pages come down.  Normalize it
for the current Internet load by comparing it to how
fast another known good site is.

I know the big document (dtlev85 Technical Reference)
is too big since I put the gif's directly in it.
I will have to think of a way to break it up or something.

Thanks,
Dave
