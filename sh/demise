hi Ian,
Thanks for trying our software.  There are two ways to upload video:
  1) FTP
  2) our own protocol

You have apparently been trying the second, which is the faster of the two.
Feel free to use our server where I have just set up a directory for you.
Let the -screen line in c:\tableau\config\tableau.arg look like:

  -screen rocket,156.46.122.21:5710+rsn.x

The images will go into the http://www.tableau.com/video/rsn.x/ directory.

To view the stream via server push (Netscape only), add this to your html:

<img src="http://www.tableau.com/cgi-bin/nph-push.sh?   
  camera=rsn.x&prefix=cam0.&n=999>

Note the two lines above must BOTH BE ON ONE LINE in your html!

If you want to FTP the images to your own server instead, I think the
documentation covers it, but if you have any questions I'll be glad to help.

Hope this helps.
Dave
this is a short test out how fast the system can business
it seems just about as fast fast as when the echo do ran was in here
maybe a little slower

Hi Bill,
I have gone back to 1.9.2 to try YUV8 to get rid of the blurriness.
I am having the following problem with WNTV.  It might be related
to the other problem of no-sync video using the 1.10.6 and 1.10.9
drivers.  Here is I do in WNTV at 320x240:

In Video Properties, I set Compression to YUV8 1:1.  Picture looks good
in preview window.  Click OK to go back to WNTV.  Picture in window
"loses sync", i.e. goes to an unrecognizable bunch of flashing
horizontal lines.  Go back to Video Properties, preview window now looks
bad.  Compression is still YUV8 but has somehow been reset to 2:1.  I change 
it back to 1:1, the preview window goes back to good, but again when I
leave the dialog and go back to WNTV, it slips back into flashing
lines.  Sure enough, back in video properties the compression is 2:1
again.

The "flashing lines" I just described look exactly like the no-sync
video I experience with the beta drivers.

I wanted to use your suggestion of grabbing at YUV8 and converting to
YUY2 using ICM so I can get a reasonably sharp picture at 320x240.

Any thoughts?

Dave
