|.Big Memory
| Big memory blocks can be larger than the RAM memory in your computer.
| External sources, such as XMS (real-mode DOS only)
| or disk may be used.
| Available memory sources are described by a string given to
| dtmem_configure().
| When a new big memory block is needed,
| dtmem_alloc() finds the first memory source in the list which
| has enough space to honor the request.
