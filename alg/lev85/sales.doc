| 
|.Goals
| Given a gray level image and its segmentation,
| the algorithm attempts to provide a single number called the uniformity.
| The uniformity may be considered a measure
| of the goodness of the segmentation.
| 
|.Applications
| Evaluate a segmented image.
| Compare results of two segmentations.
| Use as feedback in an iterative segmentation process.
| 
|.Functions
| dtlev85			interactive main program
| dtlev85_total()	produces total uniformity for an area which consists
| 					of all non-background pixels
| dtlev85_label()	produces a separate uniformity for each area
| 					distinguished by a unique label in the segmented
| 					image
| dtlev85_blob()	adds a region's gray levels to the uniformity
| 					being accumulated for an area
| dtlev85_hist()	adds a region's histogram to the uniformity
| 					being accumulated for an area
| dtlev85_compute()	computes the uniformity measure for an area
