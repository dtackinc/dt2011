| TITLE
| Algorithm: dt_sez90
| 
|!Abstract
| This is an implementation of an automatic peak detection algorithm.
| The algorithm is due to Sezan (1990).
| The peak start points are prime candidates for thresholds.
| Two input parameters control the sensitivity of the peak detection and
| the number of quantization levels.
| The implementation creates a list of peaks or
| extracts peaks one by one.
| Utility routines plot boxes and lines to illustrate peak extents.
| A simple main program exercises the routines.
