tdsnet as a service provider?

hi, 
I noticed your page on the tdsnet showcase of clients.
I am considering using tdsnet as an Internet service provider.
I was wondering if you could please comment very briefly on
how you would rate tdsnet?  I am mainly looking for a provider
who hosts web pages in a reliable and secure fashion.
Anything you can tell me will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Dave
