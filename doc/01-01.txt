  FETCH SOURCE AND UNPACK
  -----------------------
  If you wish to do an incremental build, then rename your existing
  Dtack Base Library tree to be the one you are about to unpack.
  For example:
    mv /usr/local/dtack/base/00-06 /usr/local/dtack/base/00-16
  
  - obtain the secret code from Dtack, use in place of AAAA1111 below
  - fetch Dtack Base Library source and/or pre-compiled binaries from:
  
    http://www.dtack.com/secure/AAAA1111/dtack.base.00-16.tgz

  - cd to some permanent directory, for example /usr/local
  
    /usr/local/bin/gzip -dc </tmp/dtack.base.00-16.tgz | tar xf -


  ONLINE DOCUMENTATION
  --------------------

  INCREMENTAL BUILD
  -----------------
  An incremental build is not appropriate for this release.

  
  AUTOMATED BUILDING, TESTING AND TIMING OF THE DTACK BASE LIBRARY
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  cd /usr/local/dtack/base/00-16
  sh/mkdirs.sh $PWD.solaris		# create tree for compiled binaries
  sh/dtinst.sh solaris

  Note you can use "sunos" and "sunpro1" in place of "solaris" here.

  A succesful build and test output will look something like:
      gcc -c -o /usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-16/dtutil/dtutil.o  -ggdb3 ...
      ld: Software Generation Utilities (SGU) SunOS/ELF (LK-1.4 (S/I))

  DISPLAYING AN IMAGE
  -------------------
  Use Dtack's all-in-one environment script dtenv.sh (documented separately),
  or set up your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH manually:

  export PATH
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-16/bin
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-16/libso

  Run the image display server:

  dtview &

  Generate a color image and display it:

  dttool gen color256 :a
