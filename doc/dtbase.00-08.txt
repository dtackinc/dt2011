  DTACK BASE LIBRARY
  Rev 00-08
  4 August 1997

  Note a (!) in the left column indicates documentation changed.
  
  The Dtack Base Library is a C library of image processing support routines.
  
  These brief instructions will help you download and install it
  on a Solaris system.
  
  For any questions or comments, please call Dtack at 1.608.767.4000.
  Thanks!
  
  
  CHANGE HISTORY
  --------------
! base.00-08 4 August 1997
! - ability to compile into different tree than source
! - make procedure supports GNU make
  base.00-07 31 July 1997
  - new directory structure and makefiles
  - all install instructions
  base.00-06 28 July 1997
  - added transpose function
  - added new option to X support to enable color remapping which may
    decrease color lut flashing in some workstations
    run: dtview -output /tmp -screen hws,x,,RD &

  
  FETCH SOURCE AND UNPACK
  -----------------------
  If you wish to do an incremental build, then rename your existing
  Dtack Base Library tree to be the one you are about to unpack.
  For example:
    mv /usr/local/dtack/base/00-06 /usr/local/dtack/base/00-08
  
  - obtain the secret code from Dtack, use in place of AAAA1111 below
  - fetch Dtack Base Library source and/or pre-compiled binaries from:
  
    http://www.dtack.com/secure/AAAA1111/dtack.base.00-08.tgz

  - cd to some permanent directory, for example /usr/local
  
    /usr/local/bin/gzip -dc </tmp/dtack.base.00-08.tgz | tar xf -

  AUTOMATED BUILDING, TESTING AND TIMING OF THE DTACK BASE LIBRARY
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  cd /usr/local/dtack/base/00-08
! sh/mkdirs.sh $PWD.solaris		# create tree for compiled binaries
  sh/dtinst.sh solaris

  A succesful build and test output will look something like:
      gcc -c -o /usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-08/dtutil/dtutil.o  -ggdb3 ...
      ld: Software Generation Utilities (SGU) SunOS/ELF (LK-1.4 (S/I))
      dtinst.sh: 10 Jul 97 08:36 solaris making... 
      dtinst.sh: 10 Jul 97 09:55 solaris stripping... 
      dtinst.sh: 10 Jul 97 09:56 solaris testing... 
      dtt1d: being started by dttest.sh 10 Jul 97 09:56 
      [more like the above]
      dtinst.sh: 10 Jul 97 09:58 solaris timing... 
      dttmem: being started by dttiming.sh 10 Jul 97 09:58 
      [more like the above]
      dtcheck.sh: scanning ./make.out ...................
      dtcheck.sh: scanning ./test.out ...................
      dtcheck.sh: scanning ./timing.out .................
      dtcheck.sh: scanning ./make.out ...................

! sh/dtmake.sh solaris . static		# optionally create static executables

      
  DISPLAYING AN IMAGE
  -------------------
  Use Dtack's all-in-one environment script dtenv.sh (documented separately),
  or set up your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH manually:

  export PATH
  PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-08/bin
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/bin/dtack/base/00-08/libso

  Run the image display server:

  dtview -output /tmp &

  Generate a color image and display it:

  dttool gen color256 :a
