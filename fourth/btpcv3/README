What is BTPC?
=============

BTPC is a general-purpose image coding method for lossless or lossy 
compression of photographs and graphics. It is well suited for coding 
multimedia images which combine text, graphics and photographs, and 
is also appropriate as a general-purpose method when the image type
is not known in advance. 

As a lossy compressor, BTPC is slightly superior to JPEG for photographic 
images and much superior for graphics.  Visually-transparent coding of 
color graphics is usually possible at the rate used by GIF. Against a 
state-of-the-art lossy scheme (Said and Pearlman's modified zerotree 
coder), it is inferior for photographs but superior for graphics, mixed 
and multimedia images.  Moreover (see below), BTPC is much faster.

When applied losslessly, BTPC has good performance on both natural images
and graphics.  Against a state-of-the-art lossless scheme (Wu's CALIC), it 
is usually inferior for photographs and about the same for graphics. Again,
BTPC is much faster.

BTPC uses a binary pyramid, predictive coding and Huffman coding. No part of
it is covered by patents.  C++ source code is available and may be freely used. 
BTPC is inherently progressive, and a straightforward modification of the 
decoder to write directly to an on-screen picture buffer allows simple, 
progressive, image recovery.

What's new in Version 3 - Fast decoding
=======================================

In version 3, BTPC decode times have been halved over the previous version 
(2c).  Version 3 also improves encoding speed and gives slightly better 
compression. 

BTPC decoding speed is now equal to that of the Independent JPEG group (IJG)
JPEG decoder, and more than three times faster than its other rivals. Of 
course, in the words of the IJG, it is "still not as fast as we'd like".

Where to find it
================

Documentation of Binary Tree Predictive Coding is at:

http://monet.uwaterloo.ca/~john/btpc.html

Source code is at:

ftp://monet.uwaterloo.ca/pub/john/btpcv3.tar.Z

Programs
========

When uncompressed and untarred the btpcv3.tar.Z file yields sources for 
two programs:

cbtpc	- Convert PGM or PPM file to compressed BTPC
dbtpc	- Convert compressed BTPC to PGM or PPM

To make
-------

1.      Edit the first line of the makefile if your c++ compiler is not
	called c++.
2.      rename cbtpc.C to cbtpc.cpp etc. if your compiler demands it.
3.      make btpc
	(This will make the cbtpc and dbtpc programs. Also included in
	the archive are the programs psnr and bpp which I use in testing.
	If these are useful to you, just do make all.)
4.	Some compilers (not g++) gripe that the function btpc_dec_level in 
	declevel.C is too big to optimize. This can be fixed by compiling 
	declevel.C with appropriate flags. For example, in the makefile
		$(C++) $(COPTS) -c declevel.C
	may be replaced by
		$(C++) -Olimit 1200 $(COPTS) -c declevel.C
	on Decstations and SGIs (for which the compiler is called CC), or by
		$(C++) +Onolimit $(COPTS) -c declevel.C
	on a HP/UX machine. Check your compiler documentation.

To run
-------

	cbtpc input_pic output_file [quality]
	dbtpc input_file output_pic

The optional quality parameter is a number between 0 and 100. Default is 75.
Quality values roughly approximate JPEG quality values, but 100 is lossless.

This version only reads and writes PGM and PPM raw format files (magic number
"P5" or "P6").


Comparisons between BTPC, JPEG and the State of the Art
=======================================================

I have compared BTPC with the current standard, JPEG, and what I consider
to be the state of the art in still-image compression. For lossless coding
I have compared against Wu's CALIC system, which has been proposed for the
lossless mode of JPEG, and has done well in the first round of tests for
that standard. For lossy coding I have compared against Said and Pearlman's
wavelet-based embedded coder (based on Shapiro's zerotree approach). Both
CALIC and the Said and Pearlman (henceforth S&P) coder exist in slow and
fast versions. In each case the slow version uses an arithmetic coder to
improve compression. BTPC and JPEG can compress color pictures, but S&P and
CALIC can not, so the results here refer only to grayscale images.

I have used an extensive set of test images, most of which are available
at links.uwaterloo.ca. Here I give representative results from that testing.
The programs were run on a SparcStation; times are in seconds. I have
included only decoding time - for all methods encoding time is longer. Indeed,
for BTPC, I have not tried to optimize the encoder at all, so it currently
takes between two and three times as long as the decoder to run. The reason 
for my neglect of encoding speed is that fast decoding is more important 
in the applications I am interested in (e.g. image databases). Nonetheless,
BTPC version 3 encoding is substantially faster than CALIC and S&P.

Some caveats
------------

I have chosen CALIC and S&P because I believe them to be the best that is
currently being achieved. Possibly some commercial products do better. I
would like to hear about any that are available for evaluation.

Having said this, please bear in mind that BTPC is not intended to beat
state of the art systems like CALIC and S&P in their areas of strength.
Rather, it is supposed to be "general purpose", which means it should
do reasonably well over a wide range of possible inputs, and should
run fast. Testing against the state of the art is a kind of "worst case"
comparison, so be warned!

One of BTPC's design criteria was decoding speed. I am not sure that this
was the case for CALIC and S&P. However, both Wu, and Said and Pearlman
have argued that their fast versions are fast (!) so I've considered
it fair game to make them compete in a timing comparison.

A consequence of designing BTPC as a "general-purpose" coder
is that the only difference between lossless and lossy coding is the 
quantizer step size. For better or for worse, I have resisted the idea
of a separate lossless "mode", and I am still not sure of the wisdom of this.

1.	Typical figures for photographic images
-----------------------------------------------

Here are two sets of typical results for coding photographic images.
These show the general trend for photos with BTPC falling between JPEG
and S&P/CALIC for compression efficiency, and BTPC and JPEG being much 
faster than the fast versions of S&P and CALIC.

512 x 512 Lenna:

Lossy coding at PSNR 36.9 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				1.05		1.4
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				0.93		1.4

S&P fast			0.66		5.2		

S&P slow			0.60		8.9


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				4.66		2.9

CALIC fast			4.40		10.0

CALIC slow			4.33		24.7


256 x 256 Cameraman:

Lossy coding at PSNR 34.7 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				1.34		0.4
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				0.95		0.4

S&P fast			0.91		1.3

S&P slow			0.82		2.5


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				5.02		0.7

CALIC fast			4.34		2.4

CALIC slow			4.31		6.2

2.	BTPC's worst case
-------------------------

In my test suite, BTPC's worst case was "achieved" on the 512 x 512 photographic
image "Barbara" which includes large areas of stripes. This is the only picture 
for which BTPC performed worse than JPEG (and then only marginally). The 
reason is that JPEG's DCT is able to exploit the regular spatial frequency 
structure of the stripes. BTPC cannot do this. (On the other hand, BTPC 
clearly outperforms JPEG on textured pictures with less regular spatial 
structure - e.g. Gold Hill.)

512 x 512 Barbara:

Lossy coding at PSNR 36.2 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				1.33		1.6
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				1.36		1.7

S&P fast			0.93		5.4

S&P slow			0.87		10.1


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				5.31		3.0

CALIC fast			4.59		10.5

CALIC slow			4.48		26.5



3.	Typical figures for graphical images
--------------------------------------------

With purely graphical images, BTPC's performance improves relative to the
other schemes. It consistently compresses more than JPEG, S&P and the fast 
version of CALIC. It compresses about the same as the slow version of 
CALIC, at about nine times the speed.  Here are figures for coding two 
typical presentation graphics.

496 x 672 France:

Lossy coding at PSNR 34.6 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				1.43		1.7
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				0.53		1.7

S&P fast			1.09		7.1

S&P slow			0.87		14.4


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				0.89		2.2

CALIC fast			1.40		7.4

CALIC slow			0.82		21.2

The difference between the two CALIC results is correct, and illustrates
a problem with the use of Huffman coding in the CALIC algorithm on highly
redundant images. 

372 x 619 World Map:

Lossy coding at PSNR 34.4 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				1.83		1.2
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				0.63		1.2

S&P fast			1.52		5.7     [S&P coded a cropped
							version of the image]
S&P slow			1.27		12.1


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				0.63		1.2

CALIC fast			1.06		3.2

CALIC slow			0.61		12.0


4.	Typical figures for multimedia images
---------------------------------------------

Because the relative performance of BTPC and the other schemes is different
on photographs and graphics, mixed or multimedia images can give different
results. Here is an example where photographs are embedded within two-level
graphics (UW Library montage). This favors CALIC which has a special mode 
for two-level regions.

352 x 464 Library:

Lossy coding at PSNR 30.6 dB (= JPEG coded with Q of 75):

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

JPEG				2.36		1.1
(IJG v 6)

BTPC3				1.58		1.1

S&P fast			1.87		5.8

S&P slow			1.61		10.6


Lossless coding:

Scheme				bpp		Decode time
------				---		-----------

BTPC3				5.42		1.8

CALIC fast			5.20		6.6

CALIC slow			5.01		16.4


Summary of the Results
======================

Further results are given at http://monet.uwaterloo.ca/~john/btpc.html. The 
ones given above are supposed to be representative of the general trends which 
I summarize as:

1.	Lossless coding. BTPC compression is usually between 5 and 10% less
	efficient than the state of the art, CALIC, for photographs, and 
	about the same efficiency as the slow version of CALIC for graphics. 
	It is substantially more efficient than the fast version of CALIC for
	graphics. It is about 3.5 times faster than the fast version and
	about 9 times faster than the slow version on average.  BTPC requires 
	more memory than CALIC, in that the entire picture is held in store.
	On the other hand, it allow progressive decoding.

2.	Lossy coding vs JPEG. BTPC is almost always superior to JPEG. On
	average it is about 20% more efficient than JPEG for photographs
	at least twice as efficient for graphics. Decoding is as fast as the
	IJG decoding and uses slightly more memory. Encoding currently takes 
	between two and three times as long as IJG JPEG.

3.	Lossy coding vs the state of the art. Embedded coders like S&P and
	Shapiro's seem to be the future of lossy coding for natural images. BTPC
	is competitive on simple pictures (like cameraman, mentioned above),
	but on more textured images can require 50% more bits than S&P for a 
	photograph. However, BTPC codes graphics and multimedia images more 
	efficiently, and its decoding time is always less than a third that
	of fast S&P, and usually less than a quarter.
